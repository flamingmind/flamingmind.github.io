<h1>Google Sausages</h1>
<p>Today at Google HQ, we had a BBQ party!</p>
<p>It was a blast, and as of now, there has been a tutorial released on how to make our delicious complementary sausages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Prepare your barbecue with grease and cook with charcoal.</p>
<p>Make sure not to add too much grease or it could start a fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Wait until the grill reaches medium heat (350 degrees Fahrenheit) and</p>
<p>add some frozen sausage patties to the grill and cook for 20 minutes, (10 minutes on each side,) so that the internal temperature becomes 160 degrees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Once you take the patties off of the barbecue, put them on a plate and put some butter on top of the sausages. It is recommended to enjoy the patties with some waffles or pancakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Invite over your friends or co-workers and enjoy together with a nice movie.</p>
